##Lenovo B50-80 E50-80 DSDT patches by the-braveknight based on RehabMan's github repos.

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Haswell Lenovo B50-80 DSDT/SSDTs. It relies heavily on already existing laptop DSDT patches at github here: https://github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch.. There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop series.

The current repository actually uses only on-the-fly patches via config.plist and additional SSDTs.
